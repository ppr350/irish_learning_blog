## My Irish Learning Blog

I love Irish language and I am trying to learn the language. So I decided to start writing a simpler blog to share the things I have learned.

**Version 1.0**
I use simple html and CSS to write this blog. The code is simple (version 1.0). The CSS uses combination of Grid and Flex. The Javascript file is empty but I might use DOM methods in future version.

**Description**
This is a static blog. The main purpose of this blog is to share my Irish learning journey. 

It contains a section of “About Me”. A section I called “Beef Section “ that will carry the main content “Today I Learned “ that will be updated every day. Below that there is a place that has links to useful websites. Then there is a section that will contain some methods of language learning that I find not very helpful. Finally there is a contact me in the bottom.

**Challenge**
Although the first version of this website is relatively simple, I have made a commitment to maintain this website properly, and in the same time try to improve both the code and the look of it.
